## 2026-07-20 - Focus Ring Consistency
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of mismatched or missing `focus-visible` utility classes for interactive elements (`button`, `summary`) causing accessibility regressions during keyboard navigation. Custom styles like `focus:ring-blue-500` were used instead of the app's standard design tokens.
**Action:** Standardize on `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-zinc-400 dark:focus-visible:ring-zinc-600` across all custom interactive components to ensure consistent keyboard accessibility.

## 2026-08-01 - Screen Reader and Keyboard Nav for Overlays
**Learning:** Found multiple custom overlays (backdrops) for sidebars/drawers (like in `Sidebar.tsx` and `TextbookLayout.tsx`) that act as visual "click-away" dismiss areas but are not hidden from screen readers. This confuses screen readers navigating the DOM. Furthermore, relying entirely on a backdrop click limits keyboard accessibility.
**Action:** When creating visual overlays/backdrops that can be clicked to dismiss a UI, explicitly mark them with `aria-hidden="true"`. Also, ensure keyboard dismissibility by adding an `Escape` key listener via `useEffect` whenever the UI element is open.
## 2026-07-20 - Global Navigation Interactive Elements Focus Visible Styles
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of mismatched or missing `focus-visible` utility classes for interactive elements (`Link` buttons) on theoretical and topics page causing accessibility regressions during keyboard navigation. Custom styles were missing or mismatched `focus:ring-blue-500` instead of the app design tokens.
**Action:** Standardize on `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-zinc-400 dark:focus-visible:ring-zinc-600` across all custom interactive components to ensure consistent keyboard accessibility.

## 2026-10-18 - Screen Reader and Redundant Card Content
**Learning:** Found that card-based layouts wrapped in `Link` components (e.g., in `Topics.tsx`) expose purely decorative icons and generic, repetitive CTA text (like "Przejdź do przedmiotu →") to screen readers, making navigation noisy and frustrating.
**Action:** Always apply `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative visual elements and repetitive boilerplate text inside interactive cards, allowing screen readers to focus purely on the meaningful title and description of the card.

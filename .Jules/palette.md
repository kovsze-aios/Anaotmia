## 2026-07-20 - Focus Ring Consistency
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of mismatched or missing `focus-visible` utility classes for interactive elements (`button`, `summary`) causing accessibility regressions during keyboard navigation. Custom styles like `focus:ring-blue-500` were used instead of the app's standard design tokens.
**Action:** Standardize on `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-zinc-400 dark:focus-visible:ring-zinc-600` across all custom interactive components to ensure consistent keyboard accessibility.
